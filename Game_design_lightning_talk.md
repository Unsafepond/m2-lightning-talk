What Makes a Game "Good"?
By Jerrod Junker

#### Intro
    Before coming to Turing, I was an avid video game player, MTG(magic the gathering) player, and an aspiring video game designer. I'm going to share some of the more important things I learned while studying on my own about game design.

#### Why do people enjoy the classics so much?

#### Choice - Why giving the player choice is so important in games
    
#### Merihari - Why rhythm, balance, and pacing is important

#### Modern examples of good game design & why I love MTG

#### Beauty is in the eye of the beholder - Everyone has different opinions
